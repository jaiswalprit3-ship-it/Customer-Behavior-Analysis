Overview :
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to gain insights into shopping patterns and business trends.
It involves loading and cleaning a dataset in Python, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), running SQL queries on a PostgreSQL database, and visualizing key insights through a Power BI dashboard.

Dataset :
The dataset contains customer transaction and behavior-related data.
It was used to explore patterns such as purchase frequency, spending habits, and preferred product categories.

Tools & Technologies :
Python (Pandas, NumPy) – for data cleaning and EDA
PostgreSQL – for database storage and SQL queries
SQLAlchemy – for connecting Python to the database
Power BI – for dashboard creation and visualization

Steps Involved :
Data Loading: Imported dataset using Python libraries.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected datatypes, and removed duplicates.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key trends and behavioral insights.
Database Setup: Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy.
SQL Queries: Performed analytical queries to extract useful insights.
Dashboard Creation: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization and reporting.

Dashboard :
The Power BI dashboard visualizes:
Customer purchase trends
Revenue distribution
Product category performance
Customer segmentation and behavior metrics

Results & Insights :
Identified top-performing products and customer segments.
Discovered spending patterns and seasonal trends.
Created a visual summary for business decision support.
